## Description
 This project implements an API fetch of my GitHub portfolio, showing a page with a list of all my repositories on GitHub, and creates another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the page showing all repos using nested routes while using all the necessary tools in react. I also implemented Error Boundary (showing a page to test the error boundary) and 404 pages.
